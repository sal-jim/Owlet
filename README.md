# Owlet Daily 🦉🗞️

Owlet Daily is **my project** — a calm, read-only daily newspaper UI with significant changes from its origin. It is built out of **bird** ([steipete/bird](https://github.com/steipete/bird)) to surface Explore headlines, topic desks, and classifieds — without any posting to X/Twitter.

## What This Is ✨

- Built out of **bird** ([steipete/bird](https://github.com/steipete/bird)) as the foundation.
- Heavily reworked into a daily newspaper experience.
- **Posting to X/Twitter is removed** — this project keeps only **read ability**.
- Focused on compiling and presenting Explore content in a clean, newspaper-like layout.

## Run It Locally 🚀

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Start the Owlet UI server:

```bash
pnpm run owlet
```

3. Open the app in your browser:

`http://localhost:4173`

Tip: set `OWLET_PORT` to change the port.

## Optional: Dev Mode 🧪

If you want live-reload during development:

```bash
pnpm run owlet:dev
```

## Notes 🔒

Owlet remains **read-only** by design. Posting, replying, or other write actions to X/Twitter are intentionally not included.
